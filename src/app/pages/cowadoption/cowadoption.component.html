		<p>It is our desire to give the best possible care to these sacred cows. We feed them pure natural hay, grain husk with mineral supplements and the cows graze freely on the grass in our 70-acre farm. We have constructed a barn to house them and employed a caretaker to tend to their needs. We also schedule regular medical checkup for cows by a certified veterinarian. We have instituted various programs through which we invite the public to acquire the great spiritual benefit of serving the cows.</p>
